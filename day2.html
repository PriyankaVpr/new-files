<p>A car is an essential part of our life. We use the car to travel from one place to another. A car has an engine, four wheels, four doors, one boot, four windows, brakes, accelerators, headlights, etc. The car runs on various fossil fuels like petrol, diesel or CNG. But, today, many car companies are launching cars that run on electricity.

    There are a lot of car companies that design cars with ultra-luxurious interiors and exteriors. Every year you get to hear about the launches of new cars, and each car is unique in its way. The car comes in automatic and manual modes, making travel more comfortable and safe. The invention of the car has made transport more accessible and more manageable.
